/**
 * @brief An interface to document the methods that can be implemented in the Application
 * delegate class.  This is not a *real* interface.  It is merely used for documentation
 * purposes.
 *
 * @section application_delegate_class_synopsis Synopsis
 *
 * Every Xataface project may define an Application Delegate class that helps to 
 * customize the behavior of the app.  It may be used to define permissions that
 * are granted to users (e.g. getPermissions()), or to customize parts of the 
 * interface (e.g. block__blockname()), or to affect the flow of control (e.g.
 * beforeHandleRequest()).  Although it is not required to implement an Application
 * Delegate Class for your application, it is hard to imagine a very powerful application
 * not having one.
 *
 * @see <a href="http://xataface.com/wiki/Application_Delegate_Class">The Application Delegage Class Wiki Page</a> for 
 *	legacy documentation and examples.
 *
 * @par Application Delegate Class vs the Table Delegate Class
 * Xataface also supports table delegate classes that include some of the same 
 * methods as the application delegate class.  The difference is that table delegate
 * classes customize only aspects of the application relating to a single table
 * (the table that the delegate class is associated with).  For more information about table delegate classes
 * Check out the following links:
 * @see DelegateClass - API docs for the Table delegate class interface.
 * @see <a href="http://xataface.com/wiki/Delegate_class_methods">Delegate Class Wiki Page</a> for legacy documentation of delegate class methods.
 * @see <a href="http://xataface.com/documentation/tutorial/getting_started/delegate_classes">Delegate classes</a> section of the getting started tutorial for an introduction to delegate classes.
 * 
 *
 * @par Example Basic Application Delegate Class:
 * File %APPLICATION_PATH%/conf/ApplicationDelegate.php:
 * @code
 * <?php
 * class conf_ApplicationDelegate {
 *      public function getPermissions($record){
 *          $user = Dataface_AuthenticationTool::getInstance()->getLoggedInUser();
 *          if ( $user and $user->val('role') == 'ADMIN' ){
 *              return Dataface_PermissionsTool::ALL();
 *          } else {
 *              return Dataface_PermissionsTool::NO_ACCESS();
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 *      // Hook called before the request....
 *
 *      public function beforeHandleRequest(){
 *          $app = Dataface_Application::getInstance();
 *          $query =& $app->getQuery();
 *          if ( $query['-table'] == 'dashboard' and $app->_conf['using_default_action'] ){
 *              // If we're in the dashboard table and no action is explicitly specified
 *              // then we will set the action to 'dashboard'
 *              $query['-action'] = 'dashboard';
 *          }
 *      }
 *  }
 * @endcode
 * @note The above sample demonstrates just two of the available methods that
 * can be implemented in the Application Delegate Class.  There are many more.
 *
 * @see beforeHandleRequest() For details on the beforeHandleRequest method.
 * @see getPermissions() for details of the getPermissions method.

	/**
	 * @brief The getNavItem() method of the application delegate class can be used to override the items that appear in the navigation menu (i.e. the menu that allows users to select the table via either tabs along the top or items along the side). It should return an associative array with characteristics of the navigation item including the href (i.e. link), label, and selected status.
	 *
	 * Using this method it is now possible to have non-table navigation items as well. You would just add these items to the \[_tables\] section of the conf.ini file then override the item using this method.
	 *
	 * @since 1.3
	 *
	 * @section how_the_nav_menu_is_built How the Nav Menu Is Built
	 * 
	 * Xataface builds the navigation menu by looping through each item in the [_tables] section of the conf.ini file, passing it to the getNavItem() method, and adding the resulting navigation item to the menu. If getNavItem() returns null, then that item will be skipped. If getNavItem throws an exception, then the default rendering for the menu item will take place.
	 * 
	 * @param string $key The key of the nav item. In the case of a table, this would be the table name.
	 * @param string $label The label of the nav item (may be overridden).
	 * @returns mixed This method should return either:
	 * - An associative array with the properties of the nav item.
	 * - @p null to indicate that this nav item should be omitted altogether. (e.g. if the user shouldn't have permission for it).
	 * If returning an associative array, it should contain the following keys:
	 * - @p href - (String) The URL where this nav item should point.
	 * - @p label - (String) The label of this nav item.
	 * - @p selected - (Boolean) True if the nav item is currently selected. False otherwise.
	 *
	 * @throws Exception If you want to signal Xataface to just use default rendering for the current navigation item you can just throw an exception. The default rendering will link to the table named @p $key, and the item's label will be the same as @p $label.
	 *
	 * @section getNavItem_examples Examples
	 *
	 * Given the following conf.ini file:
	 * @code
	 * ...
     * [_tables]
     *   people=People
     *   books=Books
     *   accounts=Accounts
     *   reports=Reports
     *
     * ...
     * @endcode
     * 
     * Suppose we want the navigation menu to only show the people and books options for regular users. Admin users can see all options.
     *
     *In addition, the 'reports' option doesn't correspond with a table of the database. Instead we are just going to link it to a custom action named 'reports'.
     *
     *Our getNavItem() method will look something like this:
     * @code 
     * function getNavItem($key, $label){
     *    if (!isAdmin() ){
     *        switch ($key){
     *            case 'people':
     *            case 'books':
     *                // non-admin users can see these
     *                throw new Exception("Use default rendering");
     *        }
     *        // Non-admin users can't see any other table.
     *        return null;
     * 
     *    } else {
     *
     *        //Admin users can see everything..
     *        $query =& Dataface_Application::getInstance()->getQuery();
     *        switch ($key){
     *            case 'reports':
     *                // reports is not a table so we need to return custom properties.
     *                return array(
     *                    'href' => DATAFACE_SITE_HREF.'?-action=reports',
     *                    'label' => $label,
     *                    'selected' => ($query['-action'] == 'reports')
     *                );
     *            
     *        }
     *        
     *
     *        // For other actions we need to make sure that they aren't selected
     *        // if the current action is reports because we want the 'reports'
     *        // tab to be selected only in that case.
     *        return array(
     *            'selected' => ($query['-table'] == $key and $query['-action'] != 'reports')
     *        );
     *    }
