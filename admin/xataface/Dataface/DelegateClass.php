	 * @section bestpractice Best Practice
	 *
	 * It is recommended to define a getPermissions() method in the application delegate class
	 * that is very restrictive (i.e. no access for anyone except super-administrators) and
	 * then explicitly open up access to individual tables as necessary for other users.
	 *
	 * e.g.  In conf/ApplicationDelegate.php
	 * @code
	 * function getPermissions($record){
	 *     $user = Dataface_AuthenticationTool::getInstance()->getLoggedInUser();
	 *     if ( $user and $user->val('role') == 'ADMIN' ){
	 *         return Dataface_PermissionsTool::ALL();
	 *     } else {
	 *         return Dataface_PermissionsTool::NO_ACCESS();
	 *     }
	 * }
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * Then suppose we want to open up the people table to allow logged in users
	 * to have read only access.
	 *
	 * In tables/tables/people.php
	 * @code
	 * function getPermissions($record){
	 *     $user = Dataface_AuthenticationTool::getInstance()->getLoggedInUser();
	 *     
	 *     // If user is an admin defer to the application delegate class for 
	 *     // permissions
	 *     if ( $user and $user->val('role') == 'ADMIN' ){
	 *         return null;
	 *     }
	 *
	 *     if ( $user ){
	 *         // User is logged in
	 *         return Dataface_PermissionsTool::READ_ONLY();
	 *     }

	 *
	 * @section Synopsis
	 *
	 *  This method can be implemented as an alternative to getPermissions() for the purpose
	 *  of defining record-level permissions.  A "role" is a set of permissions that are grouped
	 *  together.  This allows us to group together related permissions into easy-to-use sets
	 *  and refer to them by their 'role' name.
	 *
	 *  Roles are defined in the <a href="http://www.xataface.com/wiki/permissions.ini_file">permissions.ini file</a>, and Xataface comes with several 
	 *  pre-defined roles.  These built-in roles are listed in the table below:
	 *
	 * <table>
	 * 	<tr>
	 *		<th>Role Name</th>
	 *		<th>Description</th>
	 *		<th>Definition</th>
	 *		<th>Since</th>
	 *	</tr>
	 *	<tr>
	 *		<td>NO ACCESS</td>
	 *		<td>A contains only the 'register' permission.
	 *		@attention This is NOT the same as Dataface_PermissionsTool::NO_ACCESS().  Dataface_PermissionsTool::NO_ACCESS() explicitly denies all permissions in the system, whereas the 'NO ACCESS' role simply does not explicitly <em>grant</em> any permissions except register.  This is an important distinction when dealing with field-level permissions since field permissions are applied as a mask over record-level permissions.

	 *
	 * @section Synopsis
	 *
	 * Implementing the __field__permissions() method in your delegate class allows you
	 * to define the default permissions that should be applied to each field of the table. 
	 *
	 *
	 * Setting field defaults can be important if you want, for example, only certain fields
	 * to be editable, but all other fields to be read only.  In such a case you would 
	 * need to set the record-level permissions to allow editing (in order for users to
	 * even access the 'edit' action), then set the default field permissions to read only
	 * using the __field__permissions() method, then set the permissions of only the editable
	 * fields to be editable by implementing fieldname__permissions() methods for each of 
	 * those fields.
	 *
	 *
	 * @attention Field level permissions, like those returned by this method are treated
	 *   as permission masks that are overlaid over the record permissions.  Therefore
	 *   if roles returned by this method do not explicitly disallow a permission, then the 
	 *	 record-level permissions will be used for that permission.
	 *
	 * @section Flowchart
	 *
	 * The following flowchart shows the flow of control Xataface uses to determine the field-level permissions for a field in a record.

	 * <a href="http://media.weblite.ca/files/photos/Xataface_Field-level_Permissions_Flowchart.png">Click here to enlarge</a>
	 *
	 * @section Examples
	 *
	 * Consider the following table 'people':
	 *
	 * @code
	 * CREATE TABLE `people` (
	 *    `person_id` INT(11)  NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	 *    `username` VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
	 *    `full_name` VARCHAR(100),
	 *    `email` VARCHAR(100),
	 *    `bio` TEXT,
	 *    `admin_comments' TEXT
	 * )
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * And our application is using the following 'users' table to store our user accounts.
	 * @code
	 * CREATE TABLE `users` (
	 *     `username` VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL PRIMARY_KEY,
	 *     `password` VARCHAR(32),
	 *     `role` ENUM('USER','ADMIN') default 'USER'
	 * )
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * And let's assume that we intend for the <em>people.username</em> field to represent
	 * the username of the user who "owns" the people record.  (i.e. it has an implicit
	 * foreign key to <em>users.username</em>.
	 *
	 * Now, suppose we want to implement the following permission structure:
	 *
	 * - Admin users have full access
	 * - Regular users can edit the <em>bio</em> field of their own people record, but
	 *  can only view the other fields - Except they cannot view the <em>admin_comments</em>
	 * field.
	 * - Regular users cannot view any information in records they do not own.
	 * 
	 * @subsection step1 Step 1: Record-level Permissions
	 * 
	 * In tables/people/people.php:
	 * @code
	 * function getPermissions($record){
	 *     $user = Dataface_AuthenticationTool::getInstance()->getLoggedInUser();
	 *     if ( $user and $user->val('role') == 'ADMIN' ){
	 *         // ADMIN users get full access
	 *         return Dataface_PermissionsTool::ALL();
	 *     } else if ( $record and $user and $user->val('username') == $record->val('username') ){
	 *         // Regular users get edit permissions to their own people record.
	 *         return Dataface_PermissionsTool::getRolePermissions('EDIT');
	 *     } else {
	 *         // All other users get no access to this record.
	 *         return Dataface_PermissionsTool::NO_ACCESS();
	 *     }
	 * }
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * In this getPermissions() method we define 3 levels of users:
	 *
	 * -# Administrative users who have full access
	 * -# Non-administrative users who own the current record who have edit access.
	 * -# All other users who have no access.
	 *
	 * Things to notice here:
	 *
	 * -# Before calling any methods on $record, we needed to verify that it was not null, because this
	 *   getPermissions() method will be called with null passed as the context record by Xataface.
	 * -# We make use of the Dataface_PermissionsTool::getRolePermissions()  method to return the edit
	 *   permissions for the owner users.  This makes use of the <a href="http://www.xataface.com/wiki/permissions.ini_file">permissions.ini</a> file which defines
	 *   a role called "EDIT" which includes all permissions relevant to editing records (it also includes
	 *   all permissions necessary for viewing records).
	 *
	 * @subsection step1 Step 2: Default Field-level Permissions
	 *
	 * If we only implemented the getPermissions() method as above, record "owners" would
	 * be able to view and edit all fields in their own people record.  In fact we only want them
	 * to be able to edit the "bio" field, and we don't want them to be able to see the 
	 * admin_comments field.
	 *
	 * We implement the __field__permissions() method to limit their access to these fields:
	 *
	 * Also in the tables/people/people.php file:
	 *
	 * @code
	 * function __field__permissions($record){
	 *     $user = Dataface_AuthenticationTool::getInstance()->getLoggedInUser();
	 *     if ( $user and $user->val('role') == 'ADMIN' ){
	 *         // Defer to record-level permissions for ADMIN users ... we have nothing
	 *         // to add here
	 *         return null;
	 *     } else if ( $user and $record and $user->val('username') == $record->val('username') ){
	 *         // We want to make all fields read only - no editing
	 *         return array('edit'=>0, 'new'=>0);
	 *     } 
	 *
	 *     // For all other situations just defer to the record level permissions
	 *     return null;
	 * }
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * In this __field__permissions() method we first defer admin users to their normal 
	 * record level permissions because we don't wish to modify their permissions in any way
	 * at the field level (they can already do everything and that's how we like it).
	 *
	 * For users who own a record, we return permissions array that explicitly disallows 
	 * only those permissions that we want to disallow.  Notice that it wouldn't be 
	 * sufficient here to return Dataface_PermissionsTool::READ_ONLY() because that would
	 * return only an array of the permissions that the user is explicitly allowed - and
	 * since the result of this method is simply overlaid on top of the record level permissions
	 * it wouldn't cause any permissions granted at that level to be overridden.  Hence we
	 * need to explicitly disallow the permissions here.
	 *
	 * Another way to do this might be to start with a base of Dataface_PermissionsTool::NO_ACCESS()
	 * and then simply set 'view' = 1.  However this would disallow some other 'view-ish' permissions
	 * that you may have wanted.
	 *
	 * @subsection step3 Step 3: Make the BIO field editable for Record Owner
	 *
	 * In tables/people/people.php:
	 * @code
	 * function bio__permissions($record){
	 *     $user = Dataface_AuthenticationTool::getInstance()->getLoggedInUser();
	 *     if ( $user and $user->val('role') == 'ADMIN' ){
	 *         // Defer to default field-level permissions for ADMIN users ... we have nothing
	 *         // to add here
	 *         return null;
	 *     } else if ( $user and $record and $user->val('username') == $record->val('username') ){
	 *         // We want to make the bio field editable
	 *         return array('edit'=>1);
	 *     } 
	 *
	 *     // For all other situations just defer to the default field-level permissions
	 *     return null;
	 * }
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * This looks almost the same as our __field__permissions() method except that we
	 * are allowing the edit permission on the field for record owners.
	 *
	 * @subsection step4 Step 4: Hide the admin_comments field from record owners
	 *
	 * At this point we have almost everything the way we want it except that record
	 * owners can still see the admin comments field - but we want this to be private
	 * for administrators.
	 *
	 * So we implement the admin_comments__permissions() method:
	 * @code
	 * function admin_comments__permissions($record){
	 *     $user = Dataface_AuthenticationTool::getInstance()->getLoggedInUser();
	 *     if ( $user and $user->val('role') == 'ADMIN' ){
	 *         // Defer to default field-level permissions for ADMIN users ... we have nothing
	 *         // to add here
	 *         return null;
	 *     } else if ( $user and $record and $user->val('username') == $record->val('username') ){
	 *         // Hide the field from record owners
	 *         return Dataface_PermissionsTool::NO_ACCESS();
	 *     } 
	 *
	 *     // For all other situations just defer to the default field-level permissions
	 *     return null;
	 * }

	 * This method can be implemented to define fine-grained permissions on a particular field

	 * @attention Field level permissions are treated as a mask that is laid over
