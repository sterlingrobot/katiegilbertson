-# <b>List View</b>:  Renders each record of the found set using the full template in a continuous series.
-# <b>Details View</b>: Shows only one record from the found set at a time.
-# <b>Table View</b>: Renders the found set as a table where each field used in the report template is rendered in its own column.
